# dwindle

[Dwindle](https://dwindled-plzb3.ondigitalocean.app/) is an app that helps reduced text to fit Twitter's 280-character limit.

How many times have you written a tweet just to find out it's too long and it doesn't fit Twitter's limit by just a few characters? **The solution is dwindling!**

> **dwin•dle** _dwĭn′dl_
> _intransitive verb_. To become gradually less until little remains

With [**Dwindle**](https://dwindled-plzb3.ondigitalocean.app/), you can shrink the size of your tweets and make them fit into a single post. No need to register or provide any personal data. No cookies. No ads. No third-party plugins. Just you and your tweets.

Write your text in the box, then click on the button and the text will be shrunk... just like magic! (but with a little bit of technology)

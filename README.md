# dwindle

[Dwindle](https://dwindled-plzb3.ondigitalocean.app/) is an app that helps reduced text to fit Twitter's 280-character limit.

How many times have you written a tweet just to find out it's too long and it doesn't fit Twitter's limit?
Or your text was too long for one tweet but too "short" for two teeets? With Dwindle, you can shrink the
size of your tweets and make them fit into a single post.

Write your text in the box, then click on the button and the text will be shrunk... just like magic! (but with a little bit of technology)
